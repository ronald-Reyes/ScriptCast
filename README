Updates

1.  Created a server with user API endpoints, specifically has user routes, user model,
    and user controller to add and retrieve user from mongoDB

        In Postman,

    Tests:

        POST : localhost:3000/api/user/login

        body : {
            "email":"tmq.ronald.r@gmail.com",
            "password":"12345"
        }


        POST : localhost:3000/api/user/register

        body : {
            "username":"Sample"
            "email":"sample@gmail.com",
            "password":"pass"
        }

    Error Handling Tests:

2.  Initial Setup of React, Redux, and Thunk

        - Here I created the first setup of redux and handled the store for the user-information

        - I also separated the side effects (using redux-thunks) when data is fetched from the server


        Actions Created, with their corresponding reducers
            1. REGISTER_USER
            2. SET_CURRENT_USSER

3.  UI was made and connect all the logic og login and register APIs,

    - Here, I successfully created the login, and register pages

4.  Here the updates involve the initial dasboard page that can retrieve projects collection from the database,
    Also the initial algorithm for words highlighting and its react component are added

    - Additional actions are also added to redux-thunk
